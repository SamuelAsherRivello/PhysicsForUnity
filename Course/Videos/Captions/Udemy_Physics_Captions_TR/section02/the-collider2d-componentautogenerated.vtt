00:01.650 --> 00:03.450
The collider two rd component.

00:03.450 --> 00:08.530
In this video, we'll cover the collider, two RD component and its most important properties.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.000
We'll also play with this component in the editor.

00:11.010 --> 00:16.410
Collider is the component that defines the shape of an object for the purposes of physical collisions.

00:16.530 --> 00:20.760
As this diagram shows, we can have a game object with multiple components.

00:20.760 --> 00:25.560
In this example, we have a transform and rigid body, as we've discussed in previous videos.

00:25.560 --> 00:29.510
And then we also have a collider with both a rigid body and a collider.

00:29.520 --> 00:35.970
We can think of this object being physical in this game world and being able to interact and collide

00:35.970 --> 00:36.750
with others.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.130
Types of Colliders.

00:38.130 --> 00:44.310
The most popular Circle Collider and box Collider as shown in the pictures they give you the area you'd

00:44.310 --> 00:49.460
expect a circle and a box, and that carries most of the examples that you'd want in a game.

00:49.470 --> 00:55.770
However, there's a variety of other ones for shapes that don't quite fit in one of those two polygons

00:55.770 --> 00:57.660
and Edge capsule.

00:57.660 --> 01:02.730
And sometimes you want to have multiple colliders inside the same object.

01:02.730 --> 01:08.730
Perhaps the shape of the object is quite complex, so you could add other colliders together using the

01:08.730 --> 01:09.920
composite collider too.

01:09.930 --> 01:15.630
DD If we were to select a game object in the scene with a collider, we can open up the inspector window

01:15.630 --> 01:17.110
and look at all the components.

01:17.130 --> 01:20.640
Let's browse the properties of an example Box Collider to DD.

01:20.670 --> 01:24.030
There's a lot of properties we'll focus on just a few.

01:24.030 --> 01:29.370
The most important, first of all, material physics material describes the friction and bouncy ness

01:29.370 --> 01:30.300
of collisions.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.250
We'll cover this in a later section, but I want to note here that we've already seen this material

01:35.250 --> 01:36.990
property inside rigid body.

01:36.990 --> 01:39.260
So why does it exist in two places?

01:39.270 --> 01:43.690
Well, typically, most commonly we want to add it only to the rigid body.

01:43.710 --> 01:50.190
However, if you have multiple colliders and you want to have unique materials per collider, you can

01:50.190 --> 01:53.670
also put it inside the box collider instead of the rigid body.

01:53.820 --> 01:57.360
Another important property is the is trigger boolean.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.940
This determines if the collider behaves as a trigger.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.740
The default value is false.

02:01.740 --> 02:03.720
It behaves as a solid object.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.860
It collides with other objects and it dispatches the on collision events.

02:07.860 --> 02:11.000
For example, did the bullet hit the character?

02:11.010 --> 02:14.610
However, some situations we want is trigger to be true.

02:14.610 --> 02:19.620
This means it does not collide with other objects and it dispatches a different event called the on

02:19.620 --> 02:20.280
Trigger.

02:20.280 --> 02:24.420
And you could ask yourself in a game, did the hero enter the cave?

02:24.420 --> 02:30.210
We want to allow the character to enter the cave, but using a trigger, we're able to get a notification

02:30.210 --> 02:32.790
so we can have some game event occur.

02:32.790 --> 02:39.910
When he enters by default, Unity usually places the collider to match the size of the graphics.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.650
However, we're free to adjust the Collider's position and scale.

02:43.650 --> 02:48.870
For example, you may want the collider to be larger than the graphics, so it detects collisions a

02:48.870 --> 02:49.740
little earlier.

02:49.740 --> 02:54.210
Or maybe you want the collider to be smaller than the graphics, so it's a bit more forgiving.

02:54.210 --> 02:57.690
Maybe it gives a game a different difficulty that you like.

02:57.690 --> 03:02.940
You can choose to edit the size of the collider using the edit collider button to adjust visually,

03:02.940 --> 03:09.180
or you can adjust individual properties of offset size edge radius and you can adjust them numerically.

03:10.290 --> 03:14.670
Let's look at a demo In the two D Pyramid scene will select a crate.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.150
We'll see the collider in the inspector window.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.170
We can edit the collider visually and numerically to give a feel for both of those options.

03:22.170 --> 03:27.180
And finally, we'll play with the is trigger value setting it true and false to observe the result.

03:28.600 --> 03:33.820
Let's open up the two D pyramid and we'll select one of the crates in the scene view.

03:33.830 --> 03:40.180
And we see here that we're able to edit the collider and then adjust either numerically.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.610
And we can see in the scene view it's moving.

03:44.780 --> 03:48.410
The positioning of the offset or the size.

03:49.310 --> 03:53.480
Or we can actually use our mouse down here and do it visually.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.360
That's it.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.680
In the next video two rd Effectors.
