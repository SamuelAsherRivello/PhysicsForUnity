00:01.780 --> 00:03.200
Creating the obstacles.

00:03.220 --> 00:08.950
In this video, we'll cover creating movable and immovable objects, and we'll add spinning coins which

00:08.950 --> 00:10.650
are collectible by the player.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.100
Here's the task breakdown.

00:12.100 --> 00:18.140
We'll add the cube movable prefab, and we'll add the cube immovable prefab along with its script.

00:18.160 --> 00:23.260
We'll add a coin prefab and its script to handle spinning and being collected by the player.

00:23.410 --> 00:27.190
For the project, we'll open up section six, Video three and the scene.

00:27.190 --> 00:28.390
Crazy Ball three.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.310
All right, Here we are inside Unity.

00:30.670 --> 00:33.890
Let's go ahead and open up our crazy ball three scene.

00:33.910 --> 00:34.810
Give it a play.

00:35.470 --> 00:38.980
So what's new in this is we have objects within the walls.

00:38.980 --> 00:40.870
We've got different platforms.

00:40.870 --> 00:44.350
We've got different movable and immovable objects.

00:44.350 --> 00:49.090
So the darker cubes, I can't move and the lighter cubes I can move them.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.070
So it just gives a little visual variety.

00:51.280 --> 00:56.170
Also, as I'm collecting these coins, you can see I collide with them and they disappear.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.240
So they instantly disappear.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.990
And of course they're spinning around just for a nice visual effect.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.850
And also cast shadows, which is cool.

01:04.870 --> 01:08.500
So let's focus on just how the coin is set up.

01:08.530 --> 01:10.570
Let's do that together from scratch.

01:10.690 --> 01:12.580
So here we are.

01:12.790 --> 01:15.040
Let's take a look at the.

01:18.290 --> 01:20.030
Pick up prototype object.

01:20.660 --> 01:21.440
Just double check.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.350
When we see this, I'm going to drag out the right one.

01:26.390 --> 01:30.410
Okay, So let's talk about converting this into our coin.

01:31.070 --> 01:34.400
So first thing, we want it to be a little bit higher off the ground.

01:35.350 --> 01:36.460
Uh, you could make a call.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.510
If this is the right size for us, I'm going to say we want it to be a little bit smaller.

01:42.270 --> 01:43.920
So I scale it down.

01:45.130 --> 01:48.290
Checking the scale against the size of our character.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.550
I think that looks pretty good.

01:50.850 --> 01:52.830
Then I've got a gold texture setup.

01:52.830 --> 01:53.910
We could use that.

01:54.870 --> 01:58.050
It's often in games that we want our coins to look like gold coins.

01:58.050 --> 02:00.270
So we'll use that same look.

02:01.170 --> 02:03.480
And then let's get the code going on.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.710
So I've already created a script for.

02:08.970 --> 02:10.770
The queen.

02:11.430 --> 02:14.100
And to do that, we'll need a collider as well.

02:15.620 --> 02:21.890
So I'm going to add a box collider and I can go ahead and give a look at the box collider just to make

02:21.890 --> 02:22.670
sure it's sized.

02:22.670 --> 02:23.000
Right?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.740
But it looks pretty good to me.

02:25.340 --> 02:28.220
And then let's take a look at our coin script.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.460
This is really the bulk of our work here, some scripting.

02:31.820 --> 02:37.820
So in the coin, first of all, I track if it's alive or not, I set it alive to true.

02:37.850 --> 02:42.920
Now, typically you can keep the amount of behavior alive and just delete it when you're ready for it

02:42.920 --> 02:43.810
not to be alive.

02:43.820 --> 02:46.580
But here I needed this bull for an extra reason.

02:46.860 --> 02:47.990
Talk about it in a second.

02:48.290 --> 02:51.010
So in the update, I rotate the graphics.

02:51.020 --> 02:55.610
I'm doing rotation based on how much do I want it to rotate per frame.

02:55.610 --> 02:58.920
And I'm using a crazy ball constants class to handle that.

02:58.970 --> 03:03.630
So in here I've got some isolated variables so that it's really easy to tweak.

03:03.650 --> 03:09.080
So you can see that it's going to units in the Y direction every frame then.

03:10.060 --> 03:11.140
Back in the coin.

03:12.820 --> 03:16.840
Hear something from outside is going to call this public, destroy me.

03:16.840 --> 03:22.090
And what's going to happen inside is I'm going to use that is alive to market false, and then I immediately

03:22.090 --> 03:23.410
destroy the game object.

03:23.440 --> 03:29.530
It's not quite obvious yet why I'm using this as a live, but in a future video we're going to see that

03:29.530 --> 03:31.450
instead of instantly destroying it.

03:31.450 --> 03:36.400
Like now, I'm going to use a programmatic motion to have it slowly fade away for some polish.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.260
So this is just the setup for that.

03:38.260 --> 03:41.920
Now, how do we detect the ball and the coin?

03:41.920 --> 03:47.710
Well, I've chosen to put that inside the crazy ball here, so we're going to use trigger enter.

03:47.710 --> 03:54.520
So that's important that then I go into the coins Collider and I set is trigger.

03:54.520 --> 04:00.850
So by setting this trigger here, then the crazy ball, when it's going to get into the same collider

04:00.850 --> 04:04.210
area as the coin, the on trigger enter is going to fire.

04:04.210 --> 04:09.340
I could choose to put this trigger, enter code inside the coin or inside the ball.

04:09.340 --> 04:10.630
Either one is fine.

04:10.630 --> 04:16.750
I know in the future of this game I want the crazy ball to collide with multiple different types of

04:16.750 --> 04:17.380
objects.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.840
So I'm going to put all that here in the same spot.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.640
So this is the nice spot for me.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.100
So here I detect and I collect the coin.

04:24.190 --> 04:28.330
I check the tag of what I'm colliding with to make sure it's the coin tag.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.250
Take a look at that variable.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.600
It's just coin.

04:31.600 --> 04:37.120
And when I go here and I set up this world, it's important that I set the tag to coin.

04:38.150 --> 04:45.320
Then back here in the crazy ball, I then check to see does the game object in colliding with have the

04:45.320 --> 04:47.930
game object component called coin?

04:47.960 --> 04:52.700
Of course it does because of how I've constructed this, but it's just a good idea to check if it's

04:52.700 --> 04:56.000
null and then I check to see is it still alive?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.940
If so, destroy me that way.

04:57.950 --> 05:05.330
Once we add a programmatic effect as the coin is dissolving away, perhaps shrinking, I don't want

05:05.330 --> 05:08.300
to collide with it again and again and again as it's shrinking.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.260
So I tag.

05:09.260 --> 05:10.640
It is a live false.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.310
Then I won't trigger this again and again.

05:13.310 --> 05:16.580
So destroy me executes exactly one time for each.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.630
So that's it?

05:17.630 --> 05:18.890
That's the way it's set up.

05:18.890 --> 05:21.290
I can go ahead and run the scene now.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.800
And run into there and it disappears perfectly.

05:29.270 --> 05:29.960
That's it.

05:32.070 --> 05:35.370
In the next video, we'll cover adding win loss conditions.
