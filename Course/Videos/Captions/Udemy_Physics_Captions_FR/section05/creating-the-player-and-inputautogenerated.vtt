00:01.800 --> 00:08.190
Creating the player and input in this video will cover capturing mouse input from the user and using

00:08.190 --> 00:11.170
a target joint to restrict the asteroid's movement.

00:11.190 --> 00:15.570
Then we'll use rigid body add force for the projectile motion of the asteroid.

00:16.110 --> 00:19.820
The task breakdown here we have this is our screenshot goal.

00:19.830 --> 00:26.760
We'll add a catapult prefab, add the catapult script, add the asteroid that will go in the catapult

00:26.760 --> 00:28.260
and fly across the sky.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.130
An asteroid.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.270
C-sharp Script.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.730
Let's open up Section five.

00:32.750 --> 00:33.650
Video two.

00:33.650 --> 00:34.940
Upset Ducks two.

00:36.950 --> 00:38.900
We're going to open up upset ducks to.

00:39.860 --> 00:40.910
And give it a play.

00:43.760 --> 00:49.910
We see the addition here as a catapult and the asteroid we can mouse drag around and when we release

00:49.910 --> 00:57.230
it shoots and we can hit spacebar to reset and choose any angle and it shoots.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.270
So let's create that from scratch.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.320
First, we'll get rid of the stuff that we're planning to create.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.700
This video, the asteroid, the catapult, the two scripts.

01:12.780 --> 01:13.890
And here we are.

01:14.310 --> 01:17.460
So as a starting point, first thing we're going to create is the asteroid.

01:27.690 --> 01:29.130
We'll bring out that sprite.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.700
It looks like it's sized well already, so we don't have to scale it.

01:32.820 --> 01:37.320
And we'll go ahead and add a rigid body circle collider and a target joint.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.320
The target joint will turn off initially.

01:55.630 --> 01:58.330
Then we're going to add our own custom script of asteroid.

02:08.270 --> 02:10.520
Then selecting the asteroid sprite.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.220
We'll rename it to simply asteroid and add our new script.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.910
That's the basic setup.

02:22.910 --> 02:27.950
Let's make that a prefab and then let's look at our asteroid script and start coding it.

02:34.490 --> 02:36.440
We'll double click the asteroid script.

02:37.070 --> 02:39.510
Now, this is what Unity gives us from the beginning.

02:39.530 --> 02:43.280
I'm going to jump in and paste in what I've already created for us.

02:49.870 --> 02:50.980
Let's take a look.

02:51.980 --> 02:58.220
So we've extended mono behavior and I've used a few additional features to capture mouse clicks.

02:58.790 --> 03:02.900
Then I've got some public properties of rigid body and target.

03:03.140 --> 03:08.900
I keep track of if we've released this into the air or not, how far we're able to drag it.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.630
Some serialized fields there.

03:12.410 --> 03:18.440
We can also use a serialized flight speed, which we can set from the inspector to change how fast it

03:18.440 --> 03:19.760
should move through the sky.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.920
Then down here on update is how I handle the mouse input.

03:26.780 --> 03:31.100
And on mouse down, I set that we're dragging and I turn the target joint.

03:31.100 --> 03:35.840
On the target joint is what's going to restrict our movement so it doesn't let us drag too far.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.020
And on pointer up, I release that.

03:40.340 --> 03:45.110
And in the release is when I add the physics force, we'll see that familiar add force.

03:48.710 --> 03:49.820
Let's play the scene.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.270
Great.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.230
Now let's add the catapult.

04:49.190 --> 04:50.960
And we'll create a catapult script.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.600
We open that up and let's paste in what I've created for us.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.640
So here we've got the catapult.

05:18.360 --> 05:24.150
I'm going to have an asteroid prefab the asteroid parent where it should be connected.

05:24.150 --> 05:27.420
And the center point, the position it should be connected to.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.730
When we wake up, I'll add an asteroid.

05:29.730 --> 05:35.640
And what I do here is I instantiate a new asteroid game object from the prefab and set it in the right

05:35.640 --> 05:36.390
position.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.780
Notice down here I turn the target joint on Finally There.

05:39.780 --> 05:41.190
That's what does the restriction.

05:41.460 --> 05:42.840
Let's go ahead and wire that up.

06:13.450 --> 06:15.400
And finally, we'll put it in the position.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.080
And let's give it a play.

06:37.010 --> 06:45.980
You know, I can see on the asteroid I'm missing a reference to the target joint and the rigid body.

06:55.420 --> 06:56.260
Looks good.

06:57.210 --> 06:59.070
The centre point is a bit off.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.300
We'll raise that up.

07:05.340 --> 07:06.320
Then give it a play.

07:11.540 --> 07:12.800
Looks really good.

07:13.520 --> 07:20.360
As a last adjustment, I see that the front Sprite needs to be a higher number than the asteroid itself.

07:23.080 --> 07:26.620
So now the asteroid believably is between the two pieces of wood.

07:27.250 --> 07:27.940
And that's it.

07:27.970 --> 07:28.990
Thanks very much.

07:31.520 --> 07:35.060
In the next video, we'll work on creating the obstacles.
