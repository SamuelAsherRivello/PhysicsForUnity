00:01.380 --> 00:04.860
Creating an Angry Birds clone to DH game.

00:04.860 --> 00:09.330
Well, after all the things we've learned in the previous sections, here we are.

00:09.330 --> 00:11.640
We're going to make a complete game from scratch.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.920
We're going to create projectile motion with input.

00:14.940 --> 00:17.610
Add the game obstacles into the world.

00:17.670 --> 00:23.970
Add win loss conditions and a UI to reflect that on the screen and we'll even have time to add some

00:23.970 --> 00:25.050
extra polish.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.180
Two RD project setup.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.750
In this video, we'll cover what's the inspiration for a new game project and how do we translate that

00:33.750 --> 00:38.820
inspiration into the key concepts and physics concepts we'll need for the game?

00:38.820 --> 00:41.020
Then we'll open up unity and get started.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.560
A note about all of Section five is we'll be spending a lot more time inside Unity.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.060
Planning a two RD game.

00:50.090 --> 00:51.720
Let's take Angry Birds.

00:51.740 --> 00:54.860
A popular mobile physics game as our inspiration.

00:54.860 --> 01:01.130
Here's a very basic screenshot showing some illustration of where major parts of the screen will be.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.200
We're going to keep the 2D game play.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.300
We're going to use projectile motion.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.650
That blue ball would fly through the air toward the Pac-Man yellow character.

01:09.650 --> 01:14.060
We'll have physics collisions with the green ground and the crates that are brown.

01:14.060 --> 01:17.650
We'll have explosions and we'll have a light, fun art style.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.750
This represents the end graphics that we're shooting for.

01:20.780 --> 01:23.060
The game that we create will look like this.

01:23.060 --> 01:26.720
The rules of our game, we're going to call it upset ducks.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.770
The rules are to kill all the ducks using limited asteroids to win.

01:30.770 --> 01:34.600
I think we'll give you three asteroids and you try and hit three ducks.

01:34.610 --> 01:36.590
Mouse drag to shoot an asteroid.

01:36.590 --> 01:42.410
As the asteroid collides with the objects, it will remove health from ducks and crates the duck health.

01:42.410 --> 01:45.290
When it reaches zero, the duck will die and give you points.

01:45.290 --> 01:46.340
The crate health.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.840
When it reaches zero, it will explode and that will help clear out the level so that you can hit the

01:50.840 --> 01:51.520
ducks.

01:51.530 --> 01:53.120
Let's talk about the physics involved.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.380
There's three major steps.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.840
As you can see, we have an asteroid inside of a catapult.

01:56.840 --> 02:01.070
We're going to use Target joint to pull that back with the mouse and release it.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.050
The asteroids flight through the air.

02:03.050 --> 02:06.110
We'll be using physics, add force and gravity.

02:06.110 --> 02:11.570
When the collisions happen, the ducks and crates will use on collision events to check.

02:11.570 --> 02:13.130
How fast did you hit me?

02:13.130 --> 02:19.310
How much damage should it cause, etc. And as a bonus, we'll have explosions using two rd effectors.

02:20.100 --> 02:21.840
Let's talk about the task breakdown.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.110
We'd need to get this done.

02:23.130 --> 02:27.150
This is also what we'll cover in each of the five videos in this section.

02:27.180 --> 02:32.820
In five one, we'll do the two D project set up in five two, we'll handle the catapult and the asteroid

02:32.820 --> 02:33.930
and how to handle the input.

02:33.930 --> 02:39.810
In five three, we'll create the crates and the upset docs in five four will add win loss conditions,

02:39.810 --> 02:45.960
including the UI that you see in text and in five five will add extra polish like the explosion effect

02:45.960 --> 02:47.310
and also some sounds.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.810
The two RD project setup.

02:50.350 --> 02:53.220
Let's use this screenshot as our target goal.

02:53.230 --> 02:58.220
We'll set up the folders, set up the camera, the ground and the background.

02:58.240 --> 03:02.650
We'll talk a bit about camera settings and also pixels per unit on the sprites.

03:03.370 --> 03:04.960
So let's open up project.

03:04.990 --> 03:10.770
It'll be in section five, Video one and this scene will look at is upset Dux one.

03:10.780 --> 03:16.930
Also throughout this section, sometimes we'll jump into a scene and see the end result, and then I'll

03:16.930 --> 03:19.060
start coding from scratch to get us there.

03:19.060 --> 03:25.030
Other times we'll use the previous video as the starting point for the next video so you can follow

03:25.030 --> 03:28.660
all the way along from five 1 to 5 five and complete the game.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.260
All right, let's open up unity and get started.

03:33.110 --> 03:36.860
We'll take a look at the upset dux, one seen as our inspiration.

03:36.860 --> 03:38.500
We're going to be recreating this.

03:38.580 --> 03:45.110
You can see we've got the Sky Sprite background, the grass sprite for the floor and these black boxes

03:45.110 --> 03:50.000
on the outside, which will catch the shot if you shoot it too far off screen.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.080
It's just there.

03:51.080 --> 03:54.170
Not for the user to see, but just for some simple physics.

03:54.410 --> 04:00.980
So we can see the folder setup we've got here animation, physic material, prefab scenes, scripts.

04:00.980 --> 04:02.900
So we're going to replicate that from scratch.

04:02.900 --> 04:09.770
I'm actually going to keep these folders and I'll just delete what we have here and create a new scene

04:09.770 --> 04:11.030
from scratch.

04:14.230 --> 04:15.340
I'll give it the same name.

04:15.370 --> 04:17.800
Upset Ducks one.

04:19.420 --> 04:23.200
Well, it's actually going to rename it for me, so I'm going to delete the original one.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.580
And here we have this.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.760
Okay, so we've got an empty scene.

04:32.000 --> 04:32.900
We're ready to go.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.740
So first thing I'm going to do is just search for some of the assets we need.

04:40.770 --> 04:42.180
Sky tile sprite.

04:45.370 --> 04:46.600
Grasp, right?

04:47.770 --> 04:49.210
Get those out into the world.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.680
Then I can just moving them around.

04:52.690 --> 04:56.270
You'll notice that the grass is behind the sky.

04:56.290 --> 05:02.230
So for the sprite renders, one setting we want to tweak is the order in layer property.

05:02.860 --> 05:03.760
We can do that.

05:06.220 --> 05:10.720
And create one here, then this is going to be our ground with physics.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.890
So we need a collider.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.160
And if we edit the collider.

05:18.920 --> 05:23.030
We'll make it so that a little bit of grass sticks up above the collider.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.810
Then I'm going to want to duplicate that.

05:29.350 --> 05:31.420
So we've got to.

05:32.300 --> 05:35.270
And move up the background a little bit as well.

05:36.070 --> 05:39.400
So we're good now to create those other parts.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.820
Just drag a black box out here.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.730
Resize it.

05:48.780 --> 05:50.010
At a collider.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.960
And it's not too important where these go yet.

06:10.210 --> 06:12.040
The idea is just to catch those shots.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.360
We'll be able to tweak it later.

06:13.870 --> 06:14.560
So there we go.

06:14.560 --> 06:20.170
We've got a good looking screen set up with the grass, the sky, and these black boxes just to catch

06:20.170 --> 06:21.970
the shots that go too far.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.070
Now, let's pack that all together.

06:27.350 --> 06:29.090
Just to have a clean view here.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.920
We'll zero out.

06:32.370 --> 06:33.900
Create an environment.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.180
And we'll put everything into it.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.560
And we'll drag it down here into our prefabs.

06:45.390 --> 06:46.530
So we're all set up.

06:46.530 --> 06:49.620
That way we can reuse this prefab between scenes if we want to.

06:49.770 --> 06:53.370
And I also started with another world items.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.300
Game object here.

06:58.350 --> 07:03.150
And that's the place where we'll put the crates and the docks, etc., in future videos.

07:03.450 --> 07:04.110
But that's it.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.100
Thanks very much.

07:07.890 --> 07:12.240
In the next video, we'll handle creating the player and input.
