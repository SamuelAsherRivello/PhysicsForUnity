00:01.780 --> 00:05.070
In this video, we'll cover physics for unity sprite shape.

00:05.080 --> 00:08.740
We'll learn what is a sprite shape and how to set it up and install it.

00:08.740 --> 00:11.120
Then we'll play with it inside the Unity Editor.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.750
This is a preview feature in public beta.

00:14.290 --> 00:20.670
The sprite shape works by tiling sprites along spline paths created in the scene as game objects.

00:20.680 --> 00:26.230
You can think of this like the platforms in an organic 2D platformer game.

00:26.530 --> 00:31.200
The game object set up with Transform and a Sprite shape controller.

00:31.210 --> 00:34.660
Then we link to a sprite shape profile asset.

00:35.690 --> 00:41.660
The spreadsheet app is a unity preview feature in public beta and must be manually added through the

00:41.660 --> 00:43.250
Unity Package manager.

00:43.280 --> 00:48.680
Now this is already done for you in our sample project, but for new projects let's learn how.

00:48.800 --> 00:54.560
First, open up the latest public release of Unity Unity 2019 one or greater.

00:54.590 --> 00:56.430
Open the Unity Menu.

00:56.450 --> 00:58.460
Window Package Manager.

00:58.490 --> 01:00.230
Select all Packages.

01:00.230 --> 01:02.600
Advanced Show Preview Packages.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.370
Select the 2D Sprite Shape.

01:04.370 --> 01:08.360
Now Select either download or update as it's shown for you.

01:08.360 --> 01:13.970
And then optionally, if you want, you can import samples to have a look at what unity provides.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.920
There's two steps to creating the spreadsheet.

01:16.940 --> 01:19.730
First, we create a sprite shape profile.

01:19.760 --> 01:26.690
The spreadsheet works by tiling sprites along a spline path created in the scene as game objects first

01:26.690 --> 01:29.510
set up an asset called the Sprite Shape Profile.

01:29.510 --> 01:34.070
It is used to define and store information about a particular type of shape.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.040
Open the menu in unity assets.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.320
Create sprite shape profile.

01:39.320 --> 01:46.550
You can choose between to the open shape, which is a long stripe platform or a close shape, like a

01:46.550 --> 01:50.660
bounded shape such as a ground or the background behind your characters.

01:50.900 --> 01:56.510
Select the created sprite shape profile and set the texture property now to create the sprite shape

01:56.510 --> 01:57.150
itself.

01:57.170 --> 02:00.470
Open the menu Unity Game object Sprite Shape.

02:00.470 --> 02:03.590
Select the created game object in the hierarchy window.

02:03.590 --> 02:07.970
Set the profile property to the sprite shape profile you just created.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.890
And now we can edit the spline.

02:09.890 --> 02:14.930
As you can see in the animation, we're able to add, move and delete different points.

02:16.460 --> 02:21.440
Now to add physics, select the game object again and add the following components.

02:21.470 --> 02:24.670
Edge Collider to DX Rigid body to DX.

02:24.680 --> 02:30.140
And if you don't want this piece to fall with gravity, set the body type to kinematic.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.850
Now let's take a look at a demo spreadsheet begin.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.650
Inside this scene will create a new spreadsheet.

02:36.670 --> 02:39.520
We'll play with the scene and see how it goes.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.080
Let's open up our next project.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.130
Here will be the spreadsheet.

02:44.150 --> 02:44.810
Begin.

02:45.610 --> 02:47.500
There's two steps to creating this bright shape.

02:47.530 --> 02:52.030
First, we'll create the sprite shape profile, and then we'll create the sprite shape itself.

02:57.950 --> 02:59.270
Let's add in a texture.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.840
And now let's create the sprite shape itself.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.030
We'll add in the profile.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.430
And now we see our profile working together with the sprite shape.

03:17.450 --> 03:18.710
Let's edit the spline.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.660
Now let's add physics.

03:31.030 --> 03:35.140
Will set the body type to kinematic so it doesn't fall with gravity.

03:40.510 --> 03:42.520
Now let's bring in a few test subjects.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.150
Looks great.

03:49.150 --> 03:55.180
We have an organic platforming environment with full physics and supporting these objects, being able

03:55.180 --> 03:57.270
to bounce off of them and interact nicely.

03:57.280 --> 04:01.210
You could duplicate this and create as many platforms as you want and reuse them.

04:03.060 --> 04:07.170
In the next section, we'll look at Unity three D physics components.
