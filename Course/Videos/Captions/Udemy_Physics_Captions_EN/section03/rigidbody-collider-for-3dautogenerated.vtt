00:01.780 --> 00:03.850
Unity three d Physics components.

00:03.850 --> 00:07.940
In this section, we'll review the core principles of three D physics.

00:07.960 --> 00:16.120
Then we'll dive into physics, Material Asset Ragdoll and train a recap of Rigid Body and Collider for

00:16.120 --> 00:16.840
three D.

00:17.050 --> 00:22.720
In this video, we'll cover Rigid Body and Collider specifically for three D.

00:22.870 --> 00:26.260
And then we'll take a look at these inside the Unity Editor.

00:26.860 --> 00:34.300
A note about two D verses three D Unity has two separate physics systems to RD and three D The principles

00:34.300 --> 00:39.130
components naming and C-sharp code for each is similar, but not identical.

00:39.130 --> 00:46.240
For example, in two D, a game object uses a rigid body two d component, yet in 3da game object uses

00:46.240 --> 00:51.100
a rigid body component without the three d in its name for consistency.

00:51.100 --> 00:56.320
In this course we refer to rigid body as it relates to both 2D and 3D.

00:56.920 --> 01:04.450
Recommended viewing Section two Unity two D Physics components introduces core fundamentals of physics,

01:04.450 --> 01:06.310
which also applies to three D.

01:06.460 --> 01:10.120
It is suggested that you watch Section two before a Section three.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.130
Let's look at rigid body.

01:12.860 --> 01:16.720
Starting with the transform component, the most basic component in unity.

01:16.730 --> 01:22.070
This component is what enables position, rotation and scale for a game object.

01:22.100 --> 01:26.330
This is the only component which is automatically added to every game object.

01:26.450 --> 01:27.620
Rigid body.

01:27.620 --> 01:33.380
This is the component that enables physical behavior for a game object with a rigid body attached.

01:33.380 --> 01:36.050
The object will immediately respond to gravity.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.120
Let's look at the collider.

01:38.630 --> 01:44.780
The collider is the component that defines the shape of an object for the purposes of physical collisions.

01:45.290 --> 01:47.180
Types of colliders in 3D.

01:47.300 --> 01:50.450
The Sphere Collider for Spherical Areas.

01:50.450 --> 01:53.630
The box Collider for box shaped areas.

01:53.630 --> 01:57.560
These two are very common, as you can see in the illustrations.

01:57.560 --> 01:58.670
That's their shape.

01:58.670 --> 02:02.330
The Capsule Collider and the Mesh Collider are also available.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.820
Select a game object with rigid body.

02:04.850 --> 02:07.610
Open the inspector window to see all of its components.

02:07.610 --> 02:08.990
Browse the properties.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.580
There's a lot of properties.

02:10.580 --> 02:18.080
Our focus will be is trigger material mass drag use gravity and is kinematic.

02:18.440 --> 02:23.420
See section two For more info on these properties, let's take a look at a demo.

02:23.990 --> 02:25.850
We'll open up three D Pyramid.

02:25.970 --> 02:27.350
We'll play the scene.

02:27.350 --> 02:33.290
Select one of the cubes in the scene to see its rigid body and its collider in the inspector.

02:34.210 --> 02:35.990
Let's open up our scene here.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.230
We're going to look at the three D pyramid.

02:40.180 --> 02:43.300
If we explore this scene, we've got a series of cubes.

02:43.930 --> 02:49.180
And the part that is important to see here is the components on each cube.

02:49.330 --> 02:54.430
In order to have full physics, we have a collider and then also a rigid body.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.710
And the rigid body we have used gravity set and we have is kinematic not set.

03:01.950 --> 03:06.090
So when we run the scene, we'll have a realistic physics interaction.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.810
The objects fall quite subtly.

03:10.810 --> 03:16.720
But if I go ahead and manipulate a few of the objects, we'll see a realistic physics interaction.

03:20.510 --> 03:27.080
In the next video, the physical material asset will take a look at what is physic material, what are

03:27.080 --> 03:31.790
the most important properties, and then we'll take a look at it inside the unity ed.
