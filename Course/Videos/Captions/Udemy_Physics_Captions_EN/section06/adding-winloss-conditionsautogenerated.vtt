00:01.860 --> 00:03.650
Adding win loss conditions.

00:03.660 --> 00:10.230
In this video we'll cover adding UI text for score and time will reward points for collecting the coins

00:10.410 --> 00:12.870
and will create a timer for the loss condition.

00:12.990 --> 00:18.060
For winning, we'll add the finish area which our crazy ball can reach and collide with.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.980
Here's the test breakdown.

00:19.980 --> 00:23.730
We'll create the crazy ball UI prefab and C-sharp script.

00:23.850 --> 00:27.330
Then we'll add the finish area prefab and see sharp script.

00:27.750 --> 00:32.500
Then we'll add the crazy ball game, which will drive the high level logic for our gameplay.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.010
And between each of these, we'll add the win and loss conditions.

00:36.030 --> 00:42.390
This screenshot represents our target goal for the project will open up section six, Video four and

00:42.390 --> 00:44.130
the scene Crazy Ball four.

00:44.850 --> 00:48.780
All right, here we are in unity and we're jumping into Crazy Ball four.

00:49.990 --> 00:56.320
Now, what we've added here is the UI and the other code for the rules of the game.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.120
This is the win and loss conditions.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.290
So let's take a look.

00:59.740 --> 01:01.810
We've got this finish area set up.

01:03.460 --> 01:04.810
It looks like a checkerboard.

01:05.170 --> 01:08.200
And we've got this collider here.

01:08.200 --> 01:13.660
So when our ball interacts with that, we're able to trigger the game to be over.

01:14.260 --> 01:20.980
Then we've got the UI, which is the time and the score and a results text that's currently invisible,

01:20.980 --> 01:26.050
ready to be populated with values of the current time and the current score, etc..

01:26.260 --> 01:28.810
And then we've got this new crazy ball game script.

01:28.810 --> 01:30.730
So let's take a look at each of those three.

01:31.540 --> 01:32.890
In the crazy ball UI.

01:32.890 --> 01:37.270
If we wanted to add UI, we'd create a game object from scratch.

01:37.450 --> 01:45.070
With a UI, we'd be able to create this by creating a game object and then creating the UI with different

01:45.070 --> 01:45.940
text values.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.400
We'd go ahead and do that in position on the screen.

01:48.910 --> 01:55.570
Then we add a custom UI script here and drag in the references to each of the text fields that we want

01:55.570 --> 01:56.600
to be able to change.

01:56.620 --> 02:00.130
So let's start by taking a look at that crazy ball UI script.

02:01.480 --> 02:07.810
So what we do is we take in the different references as serialized fields and then simply have a public

02:07.810 --> 02:13.270
method for each of them, one to show the time, one to show the score, and then in the end, one to

02:13.270 --> 02:14.050
show the result.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.350
Depending if you've won or lost, be able to show unique text there.

02:17.800 --> 02:24.040
The crazy ball game, which sits in the scene on its own game object, is able to hold the score and

02:24.040 --> 02:25.120
hold the time.

02:25.120 --> 02:30.820
And within each of those, when you set the score, for example, it just calls that show score method

02:30.820 --> 02:32.680
and calls the show time method.

02:32.680 --> 02:37.660
So you can see the interaction between the crazy ball game and the crazy ball UI.

02:38.620 --> 02:39.700
Sit down here.

02:39.700 --> 02:43.530
We set the initial values of score and how much time we have left.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.790
Those will get shown to the UI.

02:46.150 --> 02:49.030
And then on update, we tick down the time.

02:49.780 --> 02:51.970
Down from 30 down to zero.

02:51.970 --> 02:55.900
And then if it reaches zero, we are able to set the end game.

02:55.900 --> 03:03.070
And setting the end game will lock in that the game is over so that different systems in the game can

03:03.070 --> 03:03.580
stop.

03:03.580 --> 03:08.170
You no longer can have input, for example, and then show that result in the UI.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.390
Then one more thing I want to show.

03:10.420 --> 03:15.190
Inside the crazy ball itself, this is how we handle the finish area collision.

03:15.190 --> 03:21.010
It's quite simple again, because we don't want that bounding box of the finish area to feel like a

03:21.010 --> 03:22.570
box we can't penetrate.

03:22.570 --> 03:30.280
We use a trigger and the trigger allows us to go inside of that volume, but we're able to end the game

03:30.280 --> 03:32.260
properly using the on trigger enter.

03:33.710 --> 03:34.700
Let's give it a play.

03:38.590 --> 03:40.390
We can see the time ticking down.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.630
We can see the score going up every time I get the coins.

03:46.170 --> 03:51.900
And then if I make my way over to the finish area, the moment I enter that trigger volume, it says

03:51.900 --> 03:52.560
I win.

03:53.360 --> 03:58.040
I'll hit spacebar to restart and we could let the timer fall all the way down.

03:58.070 --> 04:04.630
If it did, it would show a similar message to our UN, except it would say you lose.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.780
And that's the only difference.

04:05.780 --> 04:09.560
So there's all the win and loss conditions and our new scripting.

04:12.240 --> 04:15.120
In the next video, we'll cover adding extra polish.
