00:00.180 --> 00:02.810
Hello and welcome to an introduction to Game Physics.

00:02.820 --> 00:04.830
My name is Samuel Asher Rivello.

00:05.040 --> 00:09.810
My mission in my career is to educate and entertain with interactive technology.

00:09.850 --> 00:15.150
I'm a unity certified developer with over 20 years of game development experience.

00:15.420 --> 00:22.140
In the last eight years, I've focused specifically on unity, shipping unity games for PC, Xbox,

00:22.140 --> 00:23.430
PlayStation and more.

00:23.460 --> 00:29.310
Typically on projects, I'm a unity game developer or unity tools developer, and I'm available for

00:29.310 --> 00:30.690
remote contract hire.

00:31.860 --> 00:33.750
First of all, physics is fun.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.940
Making games with physics is fun and playing them is fun too.

00:37.970 --> 00:42.950
The gameplay mechanics are experimental, emergent, even educational.

00:42.950 --> 00:46.970
Some popular examples of physics based games are Angry Birds.

00:46.970 --> 00:49.880
Cut the rope trials and marble it up.

00:50.540 --> 00:52.430
Let's take a look at the course overview.

00:53.130 --> 00:54.990
In Section one, Intro to Physics.

00:54.990 --> 00:58.170
We'll look at the benefits of creating physics based games.

00:58.200 --> 01:03.870
We'll look at the three major concerns of any physics system, and we'll review Unity's physics system

01:03.870 --> 01:04.920
and project setup.

01:05.460 --> 01:08.940
In Section two, we'll look at Unity's two physics components.

01:09.150 --> 01:14.970
We'll start with the very important rigid body, 2D and Collider 2D, and we'll move on to advanced

01:14.970 --> 01:18.030
topics, 2D effectors and 2D joints.

01:18.060 --> 01:23.070
We'll even look at a project that's in public beta called Unity Sprite Sheet.

01:23.740 --> 01:27.940
In section three, we'll look at Unity's three D physics components.

01:27.970 --> 01:33.790
First, we'll review the core principles of three D, and then we'll move on to physic material, ragdoll

01:33.790 --> 01:34.660
and train.

01:37.310 --> 01:41.440
In section four, we'll dive deep into Unity C sharp physics programming.

01:41.450 --> 01:45.200
We'll handle physics events such as collisions and triggers.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.540
We'll add physics forces to move our objects around, and we'll look at the vital properties and functions

01:50.540 --> 01:51.860
we need for our physics.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.720
We'll even get into physics debugging.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.720
So if a problem arises in our code, we know how to solve it.

01:57.080 --> 02:02.660
In section five, we'll create a project from scratch using two D something like Angry Birds.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.940
We'll create projectile motion using our input, and we'll populate the world with obstacles that collide

02:07.940 --> 02:08.570
and destruct.

02:10.130 --> 02:16.370
In Section six will create a project from scratch using three D, something like the 1980s classic game

02:16.370 --> 02:17.490
Marble Madness.

02:17.510 --> 02:19.690
We'll create a complete three D game.

02:19.700 --> 02:25.610
We'll use physics forces to move our character around and we'll populate the world with rigid body obstacles.

02:27.480 --> 02:33.300
In section seven, we'll look at some advanced topics, best practices with physics and how to optimize

02:33.300 --> 02:37.580
our projects, and then we'll apply what we've learned to real world examples.

02:37.620 --> 02:43.590
We'll even look at the data oriented technology stack or dots and the future of unity physics.

02:45.150 --> 02:46.620
Prerequisites for this course.

02:46.620 --> 02:47.970
You'll need a computer, of course.

02:47.970 --> 02:49.570
Running windows or Mac.

02:49.590 --> 02:52.420
You'll need a unity editor and a code text editor.

02:52.470 --> 02:58.030
The free personal edition of Unity comes with both some basic skills of being required here.

02:58.050 --> 03:03.870
Beginning programming, knowledge of any language, and even a dozen hours or so specifically with unity

03:03.870 --> 03:05.260
would be very helpful.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.760
But we'll cover those basics and bring your passion.

03:08.760 --> 03:12.510
Bring a love of video games and a curiosity to learn something new.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.720
Goals of this course.

03:14.740 --> 03:16.360
Have fun with physics.

03:16.390 --> 03:22.270
Get an in-depth understanding of the physics system and bring it all together to create 2D and 3D games

03:22.270 --> 03:23.170
from scratch.

03:23.200 --> 03:28.570
You also have a chance to grasp some of the key advanced topics and understand more about the future

03:28.570 --> 03:29.740
of unity physics.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.110
So let's get started.
