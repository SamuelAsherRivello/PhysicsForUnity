00:01.720 --> 00:02.930
Three D joints.

00:02.950 --> 00:06.710
In this video, we'll cover the concepts for three D joints.

00:06.730 --> 00:12.670
We'll also look at various types of joints and we'll open up the Unity editor and will create a3d chain

00:12.670 --> 00:13.810
using joints.

00:14.140 --> 00:21.370
Recommended Viewing Section two Unity two D Physics Components introduces the core fundamentals of physics,

00:21.370 --> 00:23.020
which also apply to three D.

00:23.350 --> 00:26.500
It is suggested to watch Section two before Section three.

00:27.330 --> 00:28.410
The joint component.

00:29.080 --> 00:35.020
This component is what maintains a relationship either positional or rotational with one or more game

00:35.020 --> 00:35.740
objects.

00:35.770 --> 00:39.730
You can attach joints either to a game object with rigid body.

00:39.730 --> 00:43.300
This is common or to a fixed position in world space.

00:43.330 --> 00:48.340
As you can see, we have a game object with the familiar transform and rigid body, and then we add

00:48.340 --> 00:52.480
a component of joint types of joints in three D there are many.

00:52.900 --> 00:57.100
The hinge joint constrains to rigid bodies as if connected by a hinge.

00:57.100 --> 01:01.480
For example, a typical swinging door that opens and closes or a chain.

01:01.480 --> 01:07.240
The spring joint maintains a relationship between two game objects, as if by an elastic spring, for

01:07.240 --> 01:09.880
example, the suspension of a wheel on a vehicle.

01:09.880 --> 01:15.820
The fixed joint maintains a certain relative position angle and offset between two game objects.

01:15.820 --> 01:20.470
The character joint is a ball socket joint used mainly for ragdoll physics.

01:20.470 --> 01:22.840
We'll cover Ragdoll in a future section.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.810
The configurable joint is extremely versatile.

01:25.810 --> 01:29.560
It gives you complete control and you can build all other joints using it.

01:30.710 --> 01:32.810
Let's take a look at the advanced properties here.

01:33.350 --> 01:37.220
There are many different types of joints, but let's just look at one to get a feel.

01:37.250 --> 01:38.790
We'll look at the character joint.

01:38.810 --> 01:41.760
There are many properties we'll focus on just a few.

01:41.780 --> 01:46.250
The Connected body is a reference to the other rigid body that this joint connects to.

01:46.280 --> 01:51.320
The anchor is the position of the anchor around which the joints motion is constrained.

01:51.350 --> 01:55.040
The auto configure connected is true by default.

01:55.040 --> 02:02.000
When true, then the connected anchor property will be calculated automatically to match the global

02:02.000 --> 02:04.460
position of the anchor property.

02:04.640 --> 02:05.420
Limits.

02:05.420 --> 02:11.810
This restricts the range of possible values for the joints world properties such as position, rotation

02:11.810 --> 02:14.930
and movement to edit the joint angular limits.

02:14.930 --> 02:20.150
You can do that visually or numerically by editing the twist limit and swing limit.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.950
Let's create a3d chain.

02:23.580 --> 02:29.790
The goal here will be to have a series of metal links where each link is interlocked with one or two

02:29.790 --> 02:36.090
other links at runtime will move the top link and we'll see all the other links move in a believable

02:36.090 --> 02:36.600
way.

02:36.630 --> 02:43.440
The task Breakdown First on the top, we'll use a fixed joint to connect the top link to a fixed position

02:43.440 --> 02:44.620
in the 3D world.

02:44.640 --> 02:50.180
We'll use a cube to have a visual cue when the cube moves, the chain follows.

02:50.190 --> 02:54.370
This way the cube acts like our handle and we can move it with the mouse.

02:54.390 --> 02:58.440
Use a character joint to connect all other links to the link above.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.700
Let's start the demo.

03:00.940 --> 03:06.730
The three D chain begin seen Create a fixed joint to connect the top link to the cube.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.130
Then we create a character joint to connect.

03:09.130 --> 03:14.950
Each of the other links will play the scene and will move the cube in the scene and see the results.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.720
Let's open up our next scene.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.920
We'll use the three D chain begin.

03:21.390 --> 03:25.470
The first step is to connect the chain link to the cube.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.270
We'll do that with a fixed joint.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.650
We can see now that when we move the cube.

03:44.110 --> 03:46.930
We automatically get the movement of the link.

03:52.050 --> 03:53.580
Now I'm going to duplicate.

03:57.810 --> 04:00.030
And instead of a fixed joint.

04:01.090 --> 04:02.680
We're going to use a character joint.

04:18.170 --> 04:25.550
And I've pasted in some values from experimenting before so that what we have here is the anchor and

04:25.550 --> 04:30.170
axis set to the top of the highlighted link.

04:30.380 --> 04:33.470
That's going to make it swing from the top in a believable way.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.440
Of course, we'd also want to rotate.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.210
And now we get the result that we want.

04:43.950 --> 04:50.220
Notice that chain link two is going to be connected to chain link one.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.980
Now we'll just duplicate and replicate the same setup for several more links.

05:12.390 --> 05:13.320
To duplicate.

05:13.320 --> 05:19.920
I'm using control D, but there's a duplicate option here which takes the selected item in the hierarchy

05:19.920 --> 05:21.090
and duplicates it.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.430
Now to make it look believably.

05:28.430 --> 05:31.610
I'm going to rotate each other 190 degrees.

05:41.600 --> 05:41.870
There.

05:41.870 --> 05:43.130
We've got a good looking effect.

05:43.160 --> 05:47.600
Now revisit each character joint and make sure it's parented to the joint above.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.540
Chain link to.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.460
Connected to chain link one.

06:08.380 --> 06:10.390
Let's run the scene and see how it looks.

06:17.530 --> 06:20.440
Selecting the top cube, I can move it and see the result.

06:29.270 --> 06:30.200
Looks really good.

06:31.240 --> 06:36.130
You could add as many of these links as you want and get an even greater looking effect.

06:39.380 --> 06:42.230
In the next video, we'll cover ragdoll physics.
