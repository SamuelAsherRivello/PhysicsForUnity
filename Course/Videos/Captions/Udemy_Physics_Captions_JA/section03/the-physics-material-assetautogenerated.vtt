00:01.730 --> 00:03.650
The physical material asset.

00:03.650 --> 00:09.260
In this video, we'll cover what is the physical material, what are its most important properties,

00:09.260 --> 00:11.030
and then we'll get a chance to use it.

00:11.030 --> 00:17.600
Inside the Unity Editor A note about two D versus three D Unity has two separate physics systems in

00:17.600 --> 00:23.090
two D, the rigid body, two D references the physics material two RD asset.

00:23.090 --> 00:30.350
This has an SE in the title in three d The rigid body references the physic material without an se physic

00:30.350 --> 00:36.860
material asset in three d physic material is the asset that describes how to handle colliding objects,

00:36.860 --> 00:39.740
specifically friction and bouncy ness.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.410
The physical material to RD asset.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.090
The same goes in to DX.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.910
Let's take a look at an example in three D.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.810
Select a game object with a physic material in the inspector window.

00:51.810 --> 00:53.560
We can look at all the components.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.200
Let's browse the properties.

00:55.770 --> 00:58.560
Our focus will be dynamic friction.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.010
The friction used when already moving.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.590
Usually it's a value between zero and one.

01:03.600 --> 01:07.470
A value of zero feels like ice, static friction.

01:07.470 --> 01:11.790
This is the friction that's used when an object is laying still on a surface.

01:11.790 --> 01:14.220
Usually it's a value from 0 to 1.

01:14.220 --> 01:16.320
A value of zero feels like ice.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.520
Bouncy ness.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.410
How bouncy is the surface?

01:19.410 --> 01:21.810
A value of zero will not bounce.

01:21.810 --> 01:25.200
A value of one will bounce without any loss of energy.

01:25.200 --> 01:25.800
Friction.

01:25.800 --> 01:30.330
Combine how the friction of two colliding objects is combined bounce.

01:30.330 --> 01:34.230
Combine how the bouncy ness of two objects is combined.

01:35.560 --> 01:36.950
Let's take a look at a demo.

01:36.970 --> 01:43.210
Sliding cubes begin will play the scene will create a physic material from scratch and we'll play with

01:43.210 --> 01:44.110
its properties.

01:44.710 --> 01:48.430
In this scene, let's open up our sliding cubes.

01:48.430 --> 01:49.120
Begin.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.940
We'll give it a run and we'll see that the cubes interact in the same way.

01:56.070 --> 02:01.110
They slowly fall down, turning over themselves with the default.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.080
We do not yet have physic materials applied.

02:04.110 --> 02:05.670
Let's go ahead and create some.

02:05.760 --> 02:11.250
We'll leave one of these cubes as the default and then we'll create a few experiments for the other

02:11.250 --> 02:11.730
two.

02:12.300 --> 02:16.320
So if we right click on the folder we created.

02:17.320 --> 02:24.250
We can go to create and physic material because we're in a 3D scene, it's important that we pick physic

02:24.250 --> 02:25.090
material.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.630
We'll call this one default.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.020
And we'll leave it at those default settings.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.120
Now, let's create another one.

02:37.940 --> 02:40.220
This one will make it very bouncy.

02:41.210 --> 02:48.170
And we'll use the default values for the first, as I mentioned, and then the bouncy one will increase

02:48.170 --> 02:50.780
the bouncy ness to the highest value of one.

02:50.900 --> 02:54.170
And now we'll create the third wheel right click.

02:54.170 --> 03:02.270
We create physical material and this one will make it a very slippery or slippy one.

03:03.420 --> 03:09.960
That will be with no dynamic friction and no static friction to show an extreme.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.150
We'll leave the bouncy ness at the default.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.010
Now let's assign them.

03:16.220 --> 03:19.700
We can see the highlight here on the left one, we'll leave that as default.

03:20.240 --> 03:25.700
These are all set up identically, but I gave them a unique name just to hint where we should use so

03:25.700 --> 03:28.310
bouncy we'll drag that into the box Collider.

03:28.580 --> 03:34.490
And then group three, this one here, we will go ahead and we'll add the slippi.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.470
Now let's play the scene again.

03:37.470 --> 03:40.980
And we should see them fall in a different way.

03:46.220 --> 03:48.110
You can see that we got different results.

03:50.150 --> 03:53.120
In the next video, we'll take a look at three D joints.
