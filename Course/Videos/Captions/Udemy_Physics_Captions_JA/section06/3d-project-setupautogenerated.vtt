00:01.770 --> 00:04.650
Creating a Marble Madness clone 3D game.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.710
In this section we'll cover creating a complete 3D game from scratch.

00:08.730 --> 00:11.290
We'll use physics forces to move our character.

00:11.310 --> 00:17.880
We'll add rigid body obstacles, win loss conditions and extra Polish 3D project setup.

00:17.910 --> 00:23.850
In this video, we'll cover taking the inspiration for a new game project and translating that into

00:23.850 --> 00:24.990
key concepts.

00:25.530 --> 00:27.030
Planning a 3D Game.

00:27.120 --> 00:31.860
The inspiration for our new game is the 1980s classic Marble Madness.

00:31.890 --> 00:33.660
We'll call our game Crazy Ball.

00:33.660 --> 00:37.620
And here's a simple mockup graphics of the major game elements.

00:37.620 --> 00:44.640
Things will borrow from the original 3D physics motion with input, physics, collisions, time limit

00:44.640 --> 00:47.370
and a minimalistic futuristic art style.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.600
The rules of crazy ball will be like this.

00:49.620 --> 00:52.470
Race to the finish within the time limit to win.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.120
Collect coins for points.

00:54.150 --> 00:58.290
Navigate through the level design with movable and immovable objects.

00:58.290 --> 01:02.570
The physics breakdown is will be moving using rigid body add force.

01:02.580 --> 01:08.280
We'll collect coins with on collision events and we'll get the event of when we reach the finish line.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.410
Using on trigger.

01:09.420 --> 01:15.150
The task breakdown will be three d project setup, creating the characters and input, creating the

01:15.150 --> 01:21.720
obstacles, adding win loss conditions, and finally adding extra polish with sounds and animation.

01:22.590 --> 01:24.300
Package installation building.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.030
This type of game does not require any extra packages.

01:27.030 --> 01:32.540
However, I've chosen to use a couple to help us if you want to follow along, These are necessary.

01:32.550 --> 01:36.350
However, note that this is already done for you in our course demo project.

01:36.360 --> 01:42.330
These instructions are only if you want to start a new project completely from scratch outside of our

01:42.330 --> 01:44.640
work and get these same features.

01:44.820 --> 01:49.260
First, we'll use Cinema Machine to track the camera following our ball.

01:49.260 --> 01:54.420
Next, we'll use pro grids to help snap the objects as we're laying out and doing level design.

01:55.180 --> 01:56.680
Three D project setup.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.410
Here's the task breakdown for our first setup.

01:59.410 --> 02:02.200
This is a screenshot which represents our final target.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.290
We'll add the ground, we'll add the background, and we'll add the crazy ball prefab.

02:06.310 --> 02:10.120
Then we'll set up the cinema machine camera to follow our crazy ball.

02:10.870 --> 02:17.260
For the project, we'll open up section six, Video one and the scene Crazy Ball zero one.

02:20.450 --> 02:21.680
We'll open up our crazy ball.

02:21.680 --> 02:28.010
One scene we see we've got the crazy ball and some background elements and of course our cameras looking

02:28.010 --> 02:28.910
at the crazy ball.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.980
So if we look at the environment, we see a lot of similar things to our other scenes, including we've

02:33.980 --> 02:39.740
got a floor here and then we have a copy of the floor, uses the background, just have something behind

02:39.740 --> 02:40.070
it.

02:40.890 --> 02:44.090
We zoom into the crazy ball, we see we've just got a textured ball.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.630
Nothing too great there yet.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.600
But something new is this virtual camera.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.050
So let's learn how to set up a virtual camera using cinema machine.

02:52.050 --> 02:57.450
So I'll delete the camera, the virtual camera and the crazy ball, and we'll create these from scratch.

03:06.390 --> 03:06.910
Look.

03:07.050 --> 03:11.520
So we'll create a new D object sphere for our ball.

03:12.210 --> 03:14.700
We'll put it more or less in the center of the world.

03:16.850 --> 03:18.300
Maybe a little bit off the ground.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.010
Great.

03:19.550 --> 03:21.770
Then we'll create a new Unity camera.

03:22.950 --> 03:23.910
And then something new.

03:23.910 --> 03:26.460
We're going to create a cinema machine, virtual camera.

03:26.940 --> 03:31.650
Once we do that onto the camera, it's automatically added to cinema machine brain.

03:31.680 --> 03:36.960
Now the unity camera will be driven by the cinema machine system instead.

03:37.110 --> 03:41.160
And the beauty of that is that these cameras come with a lot of functionality.

03:42.110 --> 03:45.110
We'll do some tweaking on this virtual camera.

03:45.530 --> 03:50.540
We'll have it follow our sphere and we'll have it look at our sphere.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.600
Then down here we can choose some options.

03:53.610 --> 03:59.010
We'll have the body be offset using a transposon and we'll have the aim.

03:59.810 --> 04:02.060
Follow by a composer.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.360
Now, the offset, we just turn it a little bit up.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.150
Maybe we want to back off a little bit or zoom in.

04:09.170 --> 04:11.660
You can tweak that to the lawyer that you want.

04:12.110 --> 04:17.780
Then down here in the composer, we can choose to track the object a little high or a little low or

04:17.780 --> 04:19.040
just dead in the center.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.660
And that's all that we have to do.

04:20.810 --> 04:26.420
Now, when we play the scene, we can take that sphere manually and we can move it around and you can

04:26.420 --> 04:29.630
see that the cinema machine follows it perfectly.

04:33.290 --> 04:39.230
In the next video, we'll look at creating the player and input we'll cover taking keyboard input using

04:39.230 --> 04:43.880
rigid body, add force for motion and using pro grids to position the walls.
