00:01.600 --> 00:02.960
Two rd effectors.

00:02.980 --> 00:09.310
In this video we'll cover the effector two RD component and different types of effector two DS.

00:09.430 --> 00:13.000
We'll also play with effector two RDS inside the Unity ed.

00:13.180 --> 00:17.620
The effector is the component that directs the forces of physics in your project.

00:17.620 --> 00:21.000
When game object colliders come into contact with each other.

00:21.010 --> 00:26.770
As you can see in this setup, we have a transform, a collider and an effector component all added

00:26.770 --> 00:28.030
to the same game object.

00:28.450 --> 00:34.690
A few common ones that I use in this course are buoyancy effector to d to make objects float as in the

00:34.690 --> 00:41.350
first illustration and surface effector to DD to create a conveyer belt feel as you see in the second

00:41.350 --> 00:46.360
picture, these green arrows indicate more or less the direction of movement that is applied to the

00:46.360 --> 00:47.080
objects.

00:47.080 --> 00:54.040
You can also use the others area effector Platform Effector Point effector for different types of effects.

00:54.130 --> 00:58.750
If we select a game object with an effector, we can open the inspector window to look at all of its

00:58.750 --> 00:59.560
components.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.260
If we look at the point effector to DH, we can browse its properties.

01:03.310 --> 01:05.290
There's a lot of different properties now.

01:05.290 --> 01:10.840
Each type of effective CD has unique properties, but let's take a look at the point effector to DH.

01:10.930 --> 01:13.870
First, let's take a look at the collider itself.

01:13.870 --> 01:19.270
We have to set is trigger is true and used by effector is true.

01:19.300 --> 01:24.700
This will allow that collider to work together with our effector to DH.

01:24.940 --> 01:28.990
When we focus on the effector itself, we have a collider mask.

01:28.990 --> 01:35.320
The mask which is optional, is used to select which specific layers will be affected.

01:35.320 --> 01:40.840
So you can have this effect happen only on some groups of your objects and force.

01:40.840 --> 01:45.640
This is the magnitude distances and other details of the force that will be applied.

01:46.030 --> 01:48.280
Let's do some demos first.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.490
Let's take a look at the point effector to DH Begin.

01:51.490 --> 01:53.740
Seen some of the scenes in this course.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.270
Have an underscore begin.

01:55.270 --> 02:02.980
This is our starting point and we'll add some code and some assets as we go for each scene with a underscore

02:02.980 --> 02:03.580
begin.

02:03.580 --> 02:09.550
There's an equivalent scene with underscore complete and you can look at that to see the final results

02:09.550 --> 02:10.360
in this scene.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.290
We'll play it.

02:11.290 --> 02:17.830
We'll create a new BOM Sprite, add the point effector to DX and Circle Collider to DX, activate the

02:17.830 --> 02:22.940
point effector to DH when we click the mouse and then we'll play the scene again to see the end result.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.030
In this video we have a bonus assignment.

02:25.300 --> 02:29.470
This is something if you want to go deeper into the topic, you can in this one.

02:29.470 --> 02:31.330
There's a various effector scene.

02:31.330 --> 02:37.030
You can play the scene, see the Spanish script, the details of it are out of scope of this course,

02:37.030 --> 02:37.900
but take a look.

02:38.020 --> 02:44.050
It will spawn new objects every few seconds just to populate our scene and create a little chaos.

02:44.050 --> 02:47.380
You can play with the properties of each of the effector two DS.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.050
Let's open up the next scene.

02:51.050 --> 02:52.850
Point effector to begin.

02:54.010 --> 02:58.510
What we're going to do is we're going to create a new bomb sprite with a point effector on it, and

02:58.510 --> 03:02.020
then we'll let our mouse clicking trigger the explosion.

03:15.170 --> 03:21.320
Well we've added is a rigid body to DD and two different circle Collider's One circle collider will

03:21.320 --> 03:23.300
be for collision detection.

03:23.540 --> 03:27.800
The other circle collider will be used as a trigger for the point effector.

03:31.730 --> 03:34.670
We'll set the force magnitude here to be something high.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.580
And then we'll make the trigger large enough.

03:48.130 --> 03:52.690
The collider is now large enough that it will cause damage to everything within the collider.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.820
Let's go ahead and run the scene as is.

03:56.610 --> 04:03.450
We immediately see there's a massive explosion because these objects were within the circle Collider

04:03.450 --> 04:06.990
and immediately got a big boost of constant force.

04:07.260 --> 04:11.670
Let's turn the force off and instead use the mouse to trigger the explosion.

04:19.210 --> 04:21.170
This is a custom script that I created.

04:21.190 --> 04:25.390
It takes the effector to DD, and then it has a series of booleans.

04:27.910 --> 04:33.520
We first want to disable the point effector on awake, so I'll leave that unchecked.

04:33.730 --> 04:38.840
And then each time we fire this, we wanted to automatically toggle back off.

04:38.860 --> 04:42.080
That way the explosion happens over the course of one frame.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.210
Let's give it a try.

04:47.890 --> 04:49.330
There's no explosion yet.

04:49.840 --> 04:52.600
And when I click, we'll get a one frame explosion.

04:54.090 --> 04:55.590
It's subtle, but it works.

04:55.590 --> 04:56.760
I can click again.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.770
And more.

04:59.430 --> 05:02.910
Eventually, the objects will be outside of the collider.

05:03.030 --> 05:03.630
That's it.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.040
Let's take a look at the code.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.650
This is a custom script that I created.

05:08.650 --> 05:11.630
So we take the effector to DD in the few booleans.

05:11.650 --> 05:16.810
Inside the awake we trigger the enabled on or off depending on our boolean.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.660
When the enabled is off, the effector does not work.

05:19.660 --> 05:25.700
Then on update we listen for mouse click and when mouse click occurs we toggle the enabled.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.500
That's it.

05:28.860 --> 05:31.230
In the next video, two D joints.

05:31.230 --> 05:36.090
We'll cover the joint, two D component and the different types of joint two DS.

05:36.090 --> 05:38.910
We'll also play with them inside the unity ed.
